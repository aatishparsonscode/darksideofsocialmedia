							<p>Deep Fakes are a tool to make videos that resemble legitimate events but are actually edited - similar to photoshop. The primary use-case so far has been in pornography, but they can also be used to make videos of anyone - including influential figures like politicians and celebrities - where they can be portrayed saying damaging things. The visual and audio components of these videos can be faked using a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning.</p>
							<h2><b>Coming Soon - Stay Tuned!</b></h2>
							
							<p><b>Overview</b><br>Although there are potential cost saving benefits, deep fakes pose a serious threat to the general public, something the general public should be made aware of.</p>
							<p><b>Why this topic? </b><br>This is important to us because deepfakes are a form of misinformation many of us face day-to-day which go completely undetected. Unlike how we have been trained to spot shady information given to us in a text format, seeing visual and audio fakes are brand new and an especially large threat given how we have a “see it to believe it” mentality.</p>
							<p><b><i>Current Status (Updated Weekly)</i></b><br>We plan on fleshing out a coherent script that captures the urgency of the issue while also lending itself to the audio format. The goal being that we can provide the information that can be enjoyed without a strain on the eyes while also having transcription that is easy to follow.</p>
